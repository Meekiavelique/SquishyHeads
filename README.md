A Simple Voice Chat addon that makes player heads squish and stretch based on voice volume in real-time

## Features

- **Volume-Reactive Head Animation**: Player heads dynamically scale based on how loud they're speaking
- **Multiplayer Synchronized**: See other players' head animations in real-time
- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance impact with optimized audio processing

## How It Works

When you speak through Simple Voice Chat:
- Whisper = subtle head movement
- Normal speech = moderate squishing
- Shouting = maximum head deformation

The animation responds instantly to volume changes and smoothly returns to normal when you stop talking

## Requirements

- **Simple Voice Chat** (latest versions)
